    "In the international finance industry, the dynamics of the foreign exchange market (FX) pose a great challenge to firms operating globally and has become an integral factor in the financial decision-making process. The volatility associated with FX rates can have a significant impact on the profitability of a firm. Having a reliable, reasonably accurate forecast of a given currency rate can provide a significant advantage to a firm in terms of planning and decision-making. Moreover, the ability to forecast FX rates may be hold significant value in a company's risk management strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this study is to answer the proposed research question, \"Is the ARIMA time series forecasting model capable of accurately predicting future foreign exchange rates?\". The model will be evaluated based on its efficacy in predicting the future rate of several characteristically different currency rates. The ARIMA model will be trained on historical time series data and then tested on a holdout sample. The model will then be evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict the future rate of the currencies in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multinational corporations often face FX risk as a consequence of operating across multiple countries and dealing with various currencies. Many factors contribute to the composition and extent of a firm's FX risk exposure, but ultimately, it is the volatility and movement of the currencies in a firmâ€™s portfolio that most directly impact profitability, competitiveness, and overall financial stability. Considering the multitude of available time series forecasting models, it seems appropriate to assess their predictive accuracy, particularly with respect to FX rates, so leaders are enabled to make data-driven decisions. By accurately predicting future FX rates, firms can optimize hedging strategies, enhance financial planning, and potentially realize significant cost savings. This, in turn, facilitates more strategic decision-making and bolsters the firm's ability to safeguard against unforeseen financial risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, the effectiveness of the ARIMA model is tested against two specific hypotheses. The hypotheses are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null hypothesis: \n",
    "  - The mean average percentage error (MAPE) of the ARIMA model as applied to a 90-day forecast of future foreign exchange rates is greater than 20%\n",
    "- Alternate Hypothesis: \n",
    "  - The mean average percentage error (MAPE) of the ARIMA model as applied to a 90-day forecast of future foreign exchange rates is less than 20% \n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis predicts a mean average percentage error (MAPE) of more than 20% for the 90-day forecast, which would suggest inadequate precision. The alternate hypothesis anticipates a MAPE of less than 20%, reflecting a more favorable prediction accuracy. These hypotheses set the stage for the empirical testing that follows, enabling a detailed analysis of the ARIMA model's practical applicability in FX rate forecasting."
